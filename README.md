Mutation Energy Analysis Toolset
A set of tools to analyze interaction energy changes when designing a variant protein

## Overview
Protein engineers will often start from an existing structure and introduce mutations
that are intended to stabilize the protein. This set of tools is intended to help
determine what is specifically causing any observed energetic change between
the wild-type and the variant.

### Please Note
This tool is not intended as a design pipeline. It is an analysis pipeline you
apply to a design you already obtained.

## Toolset
* Automatically clean pdb files, determine mutations, and calculate the Rosetta Energy Breakdown
* Plot of residue energy vs. residue depth
* Heatmap of residue interaction energies
* Browser Viewer of PDB structure
