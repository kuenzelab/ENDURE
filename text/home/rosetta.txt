This application makes use of The Rosetta Software, a set of algorithms and
tools for computational modeling and analysis of protein structures. Due to
licensing restrictions, this software cannot be provided in an open source
repository. Therefore, users will need to provide the path to the Rosetta
executable on their computer.

For example, a path to the executable would look something like this:
```/home/iwe22/rosetta3.13/main/source/bin/residue_energy_breakdown.static.linuxgccrelease```

If you are accessing this application through a webserver, the owner of the
webserver has already taken care of this requirement.
