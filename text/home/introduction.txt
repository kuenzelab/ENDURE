This app contains a set of interactive tools to help determine key interactions
within a protein structure that affect its stability and/or activity.
This is designed to compare a single designed structure against its wild-type,
not an array of designed structures. Furthermore, the analysis protocols do
not support insertions and deletions. The variant structure should have the
same length as the wild-type in order for the analysis to be accurate.
