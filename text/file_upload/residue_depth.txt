Residue depth is calculated using the Biopython library. Residue depth is
defined as the average distance (in angstroms) of the atoms in a residue from
the solvent accessible surface. While the tertiary and secondary structure of
a variant protein may remain the same, the side chain conformation of a mutated
residue could shift, causing a change in its calculated depth.

These calculations are long enough to make the GUI thread hang, so they
are executed in a separate thread. Because of this, there may be a slight delay between
when the status says "Residue Depth Calculated" and when the calculations
are actually finished.
