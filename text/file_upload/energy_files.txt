Energy breakdown files are created by the Rosetta protocol ```residue_energy_breakdown```

Rosetta is run in the background to prevent the GUI thread from hanging.
Because of this, there may be a slight delay between
when the status says "Energy Breakdown Calculated" and when the calculations
are actually finished.
